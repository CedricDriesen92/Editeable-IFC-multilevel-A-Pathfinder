# Editeable-IFC-multilevel-A-Pathfinder
Upload IFC files that get divided by floor into 2D grids containing (empty/floor/wall/door/stair) and connections to other floors are through common stair locations. Interactivity comes from choice of grid size (default: 10cm), grid editing/painting, diagonal/cost choices, and wall avoidance levels. Finally a 3D A* can be run.
